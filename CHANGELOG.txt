tek_vxi1_1.05 - 2014-06-11

Updated to use vxi11 shared library.
tek_user is now compiled as a shared library.
Added alternate build script for CMake.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tek_1.04 - 17/08/2009

Bug fix: (tgetwf.c): default behaviour is now "clear_sweeps=TRUE" i.e. scope
is set to "single acquisition" mode, and will not acquire waveform until
"OPC?" (operation complete?) returns. Makes more sence when doing averaging,
and there does not appear to be any overhead in sample mode (ie no averaging).
Previous behaviour can be asserted using the "-noclsw" flag.

Also updated the help text, indicating the correct form to use to read the
reference channels on 4000-series scopes (REF1-REF4).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tek_1.03 - 9/09/2008

Bug fix: (tek_user.h): added in the declaration of the function:
long  tek_scope_write_wfi_file(CLINK *clink, char *wfiname, char *source, ...)
(which I'd forgotten to do).

Refined the tek_scope_set_averages() and tek_scope_get_averages() fns, to
account for the additional "hi-res" mode on 4000-series scopes, and to also
account for the fact that in envelope mode on 4000-series scopes you cannot
set a finite number of envelopes (like you can on the 3000-series scopes). On
4000-series scopes, you are only permitted to have an infinite number of
envelopes.

NOTE THIS MAY CAUSE AN UNINTENDED CHANGE OF BEHAVIOUR IN SOME PROGRAMS,
as the API is broken slightly. In previous versions, setting the no
of averages to either 0 or 1 caused the scope to go into sample mode.
Now, if you set no_averages to be 1, the scope will go into hi-res
mode (setting it to 0 still sets sample mode). CAUTION.

tgetwf.c: added the -p, -h, -s, -e, and -no_e switches, to allow explicit
setting of peak detect, hires, sample and envelope modes, and (on 3000-series
scopes) the setting of the number of envelopes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tek_1.02 - 3/09/2008

Added the tek_afg utility (mostly written by Matt Clark). Allows you to set a
few of the waveform parameters from the command line, such as turning channels
on and off, changing the peak-peak voltage, frequency or phase. Also allows
you to send an arbitrary command to the Tek AFG (or in fact to any VXI11
instrument).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tek_1.01 - 01/06/2007

Quite a major revision, brought on by finally getting hold of an MSO4000.

tek_user:
Channels are no longer just char's, otherwise how would you specify digital 
channels? Backwards char compatibility is provided by a few wrapper functions
and an improved version of tek_scope_channel_str().

Added ability to set record length.

Found out that on the 4000 series scopes, there's a new query
"HOR:MAIN:SAMPLERATE?" which doesn't seem to suffer from the bloody annoying
time lag of XINCR being updated on the 3000 series. Hence a
tek_scope_is_TDS3000() fn to find out what the scope is, and different ways
of getting the actual number of points, depending on scope model.

tgetwf: added ability to set number of points (actually the horizontal
record length).

tek_load_setup: increased buffer size from 10000 to 25000 to cope with all
the extra settings required for MSO4000 scopes.

tek_save_setup: ditto

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tek_1.00 - 17/05/2007

Initial release. Probably buggy. Only tested (briefly) on TDS3054B scope and
AFG3252 arbitrary function generator.
